# A Unique Take on the Marathon: Ainsley Chapman, the Speedy Spud

In an unexpected but delightful twist of athleticism and whimsy, Ainsley Chapman is set to run in the Salt Lake City Marathon, **dressed as a potato**. This isn't just a quirky costume choice; it serves a marvelous purpose—representing potato farmers across the U.S. After a nationwide search for the "Speedy Spud," Chapman was chosen, bringing the charm of potatoes to the forefront of fitness culture.

## The Nutrient-Dense Motivation Behind the Costume

Chapman, who balances her life as a full-time engineer with the rigors of training for a half marathon, shares her love for potatoes as a staple in her diet. “**Potatoes are an American classic**. I have been eating them for as long as I have been living,” she commented, emphasizing their nutrient-dense qualities. This endorsement is particularly significant as the initiative aims to promote the goodness of potatoes through engaging and approachable methods.

Moreover, Potatoes USA, a betrothed marketing and research organization, began this initiative in 2024 with a vision to create powerful connections between athletes and the potato farming community. By donning a potato costume, Chapman isn't just running; she's racing for a cause that celebrates agricultural tradition.

The **Salt Lake City Marathon** kicks off this Saturday, April 26 at 7 a.m., weaving through the city from the University of Utah to Washington Square Park. Anticipate a dazzling sight as Chapman takes on the course in her potato getup, bringing smiles to faces. This is more than just a race; it's a celebration of **potatoes and humanity**, where **health**, **humor**, and **community** converge.

With such boldness and spirit, we can certainly expect her to run like the wind—**the embodiment of potatoes sprinting toward a healthier future**. Be sure to cheer her on and spread the word about the nutritional benefits of this beloved vegetable as you watch the Speedy Spud make her mark!
