Fresh Solutions Network® (FSN) introduces a way for shoppers to prepare **healthy steak fries** and **potato wedges** at home with **Side Delights®**. According to a recent ranking of potato dishes, the French Fry emerged as the top choice—but it's often misunderstood as an unhealthy option. Fortunately, **potatoes** are finally being recognized for their nutrients and benefits, encouraging home cooks to embrace this versatile ingredient.

## Nutritional Value of Potatoes

While often vilified for its carbohydrate content, the complex carbohydrates in potatoes contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are essential to a healthy diet. Potatoes are recognized as powerful appetite suppressants, scoring high in satiety index studies that evaluate foods' "fullness" levels.

According to Kathleen Triou, president and CEO of FSN, “Potatoes in any form are getting recognition for their **nutritional value, satiety, and mealtime flexibility**.” With the focus on healthy preparation methods, homemade steak fries and potato wedges present exciting foodservice trends.

## Easy Potato Preparation

Side Delights® makes preparation simple with their "A Cut Above" line of fresh-cut potatoes, available in various styles including steak fries and wedges. Unlike frozen options, these potatoes are fresh and pre-cut, allowing for nutritious **French fries** to effortlessly grace your table.

When comparing typical alternatives such as tempura green beans—which contain **260 calories** in a five-piece serving—to a serving of fresh potatoes (about **110 calories** for 148g), it's clear that the latter is a superior choice. Plus, they pack **30% of the daily value of Vitamin C**, making them a healthy addition to any meal.
