# Sweet Meets Salty: Utz's New Lemonade Potato Chips

In a daring twist, Utz has announced the release of their **limited edition lemonade potato chips**, showcasing a unique combination that promises to be *summer in a bite*. This unexpected flavor is not just a culinary experiment; it also serves a noble purpose in the fight against childhood cancer.

## A Flavor that Fights for a Cause

Utz, a leading salty snack brand, is partnering with **Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation**, the largest independent childhood cancer charity in the U.S. With each bag of **lemonade potato chips** sold, Utz will donate a portion of the proceeds—up to $25,000—to support cancer research and initiatives aimed at helping children affected by this devastating illness.

“Just in time for summer,” says Stacey Schultz, senior vice president of marketing at Utz, “these chips deliver the nostalgic sweet and tart taste of lemonade, paired with the satisfying crunch of classic potato chips.” The blend is a creativity-driven homage to summer flavors, perfectly timed for snack lovers looking for something new.

## Availability and Additional Information

The **lemonade potato chips**, which will be sold in 7.75-oz. bags, are available through August while supplies last. Snacks can be purchased online at [utzsnacks.com](https://www.utzsnacks.com) and at various retailers nationwide. This initiative not only feeds a craving but also reminds us that even snacks can contribute to monumental changes.
