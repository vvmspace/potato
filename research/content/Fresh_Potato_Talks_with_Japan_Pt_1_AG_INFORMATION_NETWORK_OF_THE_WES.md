# Fresh Potato Talks with Japan Pt 1

From the Ag Information Network, I’m Bob Larson. Potentially good news for **potato** growers as word gets out that the Trump administration has begun talks with Japan to eliminate tariff and non-tariff trade barriers.

## Access and Economic Impact of Fresh Potatoes

National Potato Council CEO, Kam Quarles says they’ve been on this for a while...

QUARLES … “Since it became obvious that there was going to be a negotiation, specifically with Japan, we have been pushing the administration, and members of Congress have certainly been weighing in, wanting to make this market access for U.S. fresh product, fresh potatoes, part of whatever negotiated settlement comes out of all of this tariff volatility.”

Getting **fresh potato** access into Japan, Quarles says would be incredible …

QUARLES … “If we are able to get that access, the estimates are, it would add about $150 million a year in new U.S. ag exports. But we’ve got to get past the protectionism within Japan and that’s a tall order.”

Because, Quarles says years and years of talks have produced virtually nothing …

QUARLES … “Clearly, I think the Japanese would prefer to continue to negotiate on this thing until the end of time. They’ve been doing it for two decades now and they’d like to just repeat that.”

Stay tuned for more on a possible breakthrough for fresh U.S. potato exports to Japan.
