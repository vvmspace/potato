# Wisconsin's Certified Seed Potato Bill Clears State Senate

In a unanimous decision, the **Wisconsin State Senate** advanced legislation designed to fortify the state's **certified seed potato** regulations, crucial for safeguarding the region's esteemed potato crop.

## Legislative Impact on Potato Crop

Patrick Testin, the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, shared insights on **Senate Bill 164**, which not only escalates fines from a mere $150 to a staggering **$5,000** for violations but also imposes an additional $5,000 for every acre planted in violation. This move is significant given the **potato crop** was valued at an impressive **$320 million** last year, with certified seed cultivated on about **9,600 acres** equating to an estimated **$75 million**.

The bill empowers the **Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection** (DATCP) to eliminate uncertified seed potatoes, aiming to preserve the integrity of state agriculture. Notably, the existing exemption for growers planting fewer than five acres remains unchanged, allowing small-scale farmers some flexibility.

## Transition to Grazing Pilot Program

While the certified seed potato bill has cleared the Senate, attention shifts to another agricultural initiativeâ€”a **transition to grazing pilot program**. Testin indicated that, although bipartisan support exists, this bill is currently on hold pending a court case that could influence its outcome.

As legislative sessions continue, public budget hearings are also scheduled, glimpsing the complexities of state spending and collaboration between the Republican-led legislature and Democratic Governor Tony Evers.

Wisconsin's movements in agricultural policy underscore a commitment to ensuring not just the **seed potato** law but the very foundations of the state's agricultural heritage remain robust. A promising future awaits, illuminated by the commitment to progress and innovation.
