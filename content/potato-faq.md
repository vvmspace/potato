# Potato FAQ: People Also Ask

Are you here because you want the truth about potatoes, or just to settle an argument at dinner? Either way, let’s dissect the most common potato inquiries with a dash of sarcasm that this starchy vegetable deserves.

## Is it spelled potatoes or potatos?

Let's set the record straight: it’s *potatoes*. If anyone feels the need to argue with you over this, consider their taste in spelling as questionable as their taste in fries. The plural of potato is always going to be “potatoes.” No debate here.

## Does potato have carbohydrates?

Ah, the million-dollar question. Yes, potatoes are indeed rich in carbohydrates. Surprise, right? They’re not hiding in the corner simply crunching numbers; they’re bringing the starchiness to your plate. So, if you’re trying to cut back on carbs, maybe reconsider that loaded baked potato.

## Is potato good for diabetes?

This one’s a bit nuanced. While potatoes, particularly when prepared healthily, can fit into a balanced diet, they do have a high glycemic index (G.I.). That means they can spike blood sugar levels quicker than you can say “mashed potatoes.” If you're a diabetes warrior, moderation and pairing them with other nutrients is key. Always consult your doctor before making any dietary choices, and don’t let just any tuber tell you what’s good for your blood sugar.

## What is the plural of potato?

As we’ve covered, it’s *potatoes*. I can’t stress this enough: *potato* is singular, and *potatoes* is plural. Let's save ourselves from the confusion of "two potato" soup when it should be "two potatoes."

So there you have it. From spelling to nutrition, your potato questions are answered with the kind of smart sass that only comes from deep knowledge of this humble tuber. The world is full of mysteries, but the potato doesn’t have to be one of them.
