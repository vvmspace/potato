# UPEI Students Transform Unused Potatoes into Award-Winning Soap

In an inspiring twist of fate, a group of enterprising students from the University of Prince Edward Island have taken the concept of sustainability to another level by creating **potato soap** from excess potatoes that would otherwise go to waste. Meet **Spuds2Suds**, the innovative project that converts **P.E.I. potatoes** into an eco-friendly hygiene product, recently celebrated with awards at a Halifax competition.

## The Journey of Spuds2Suds

Maggie McNeil, one of the co-presidents of **Enactus UPEI**, explained how they utilized a specific essential oil called **Sugar Plum**, infusing their soap with delightful notes of vanilla and jasmine. Amidst the staggering statistic that approximately **300 million pounds** of P.E.I. potatoes go unused every year, the Spuds2Suds initiative has taken steps to alleviate this waste.

By collaborating with local farmers, the group collects potatoes that remain in the fields after harvest, juices them to extract **liquid starch**, and combines it with hydrating oils to create their potato soap. This process not only promotes sustainability but also supports local farmers and food banks by supplying much-needed hygiene products.

## A Commitment to Sustainability

The health benefits of the **potato soap** are notable; potatoes are rich in natural minerals and serve as effective exfoliants. McNeil emphasized the absence of preservatives in their product, showcasing their commitment to organic ingredients sourced right from the ground in **P.E.I.**.

The positive feedback has been overwhelming; **Veseys spokesperson Tara Matheson** noted the rapid sales of the soap, expressing pride in supporting local businesses.

## Looking Ahead

As McNeil and her fellow co-president, **Sam Harding**, are set to graduate, their aspiration for **Spuds2Suds** is to ensure its legacy continues beyond their tenure at the university. They hope to keep students engaged in the initiative, emphasizing the importance of community and local issues.

The **Spuds2Suds potato soap** is available for purchase at the UPEI bookstore and selected local markets, proving that transformation doesnâ€™t just occur in the soap, but within the community itself. Through innovation and sustainability, UPEI students are making waves, reminding us all that even the most humble **potato** can spark significant change.
