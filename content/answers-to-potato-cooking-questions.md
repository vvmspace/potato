## Why Soak Potatoes in Water?

Soaking potatoes in water before cooking helps to remove excess starch, which can lead to a fluffier texture when baked or fried. It also prevents potatoes from turning gray and enhances their flavor.

Finding the best ways to cook potatoes depends on what you want to achieve. Here are some popular methods:

- **Boiling:** Ideal for mashed potatoes. Boil until tender.  
- **Baking:** Perfect for fluffy interiors—think baked potatoes.  
- **Roasting:** For crispy edges and a rich flavor.  
- **Frying:** Great for homemade fries or chips.  

## Potato Prep Tips

Preparing potatoes correctly makes a difference in your dishes. Here are some key potato prep tips:

1. **Choose the Right Variety:** Different potatoes serve different purposes—Yukon Gold for mashing, Russets for baking, etc.
2. **Cut Evenly:** Ensure even cooking by cutting potatoes into similar sizes.
3. **Avoid Overcrowding:** When roasting or frying, give potatoes space to ensure they crisp up nicely.
