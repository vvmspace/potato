# The U.S. Potato Industry Seeks Trade Deal: A $150 Million Opportunity

The U.S. potato industry is alive with optimism as discussions with Japan signal potential for a fresh trade deal. With an opportunity estimated at **$150 million** each year, U.S. potato growers are eager for fresh tablestock potatoes to enter the Japanese market.

## The Potential of Fresh Potatoes in Japan

Kam Quarles, CEO of the National Potato Council, has shared his insights with Brownfield, expressing hope for these trade discussions that have been ongoing for years. The barriers have been largely political, creating a non-tariff trade hindrance.

This latest development and the ongoing meetings between Japanese and U.S. trade officials could pave the way for substantial changes. Quarles emphasized the ongoing volatility within the trade landscape, but he remains positive about the leverage this situation provides for negotiations.

As the U.S. expands its trade discussions with other nations like Vietnam and Thailand, there is a collective desire within the potato industry to restore tariff benefits from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The stakes are high, and the potential for growth in the market is undeniable.

In a world full of chaos, the future of the U.S. potato industry shines a little brighter today. Fresh potatoes might just find new roots in Japan, allowing farmers to flourish and for delicious potato-based dishes to make their way to new tables.
