# Fresh Potato Talks with Japan Pt 2

In a landscape marked by agricultural negotiations, **talks with Japanese officials** are stirring hopes for better trade agreements and improved access for **U.S. fresh potatoes** in Japan. 

## The Unfolding Story of Trade

From the Ag Information Network, Bob Larson relays insights from Kam Quarles, CEO of the **National Potato Council**, who articulates the cautious optimism surrounding these discussions. Quarles emphasizes that while the potential for enhanced **U.S. potato access** remains, it’s premature to jump to conclusions about the outcomes.

“From the administration’s side of things, I don’t know how much they got into the substance of any one of the issues, but we certainly believe that this is going to be front and center,” Quarles states. 

This potential access is pivotal, especially considering the backdrop of Japan's larger trade relationships formed under the defunct **Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement**. 

## A Look Ahead

The stakes are high. Quarles highlights the pressing concern surrounding tariffs that might hinder the reach of potato products to vital markets, suggesting that restoring tariff benefits is crucial. As the U.S. potato industry leans heavily on exports, navigating these trade discussions is imperative for future viability.

Indeed, as discussions progress, the possibility of **U.S. fresh potato access** in Japan bears watching—like a tender sprout pushing through the soil, hopeful yet uncertain, fighting against the odds of its environment.
