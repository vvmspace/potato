# From Potato Guns to Pearl Harbor: Vaughn Paape's Engineering Journey

Vaughn Paape's story is one of transformation—a journey from playful experimentation in his father's garage to a career as a **nuclear engineer** at **Pearl Harbor**. As he prepares to begin his first professional role this July, Paape reflects on many moments that brought him to this point, showcasing how far a journey can take you, even from the humble beginnings of building **potato guns**.

## A Unique Foundation in Engineering

Growing up in a farm community, Paape found solace in **hands-on tinkering**. With a carpenter father and the freedom of being **homeschooled**, he created contraptions that fueled his engineering aspirations. It was a childhood spent crafting **potato cannons** and **catapults** in a garage—experiments that transformed into a fascination with mechanics and design.

His enthusiasm for these structured creations contrasted sharply with the isolation of his rural upbringing, where **only church gatherings** provided moments of social interaction. Driven by a desire for more companionship, he transitioned to a traditional public school, paving the way for his move to **Arizona** and ultimately to **Grand Canyon University**.

## Engineering Innovations and Achievements

At GCU, Vaughn thrived in an environment that nurtured his curiosity. He credits professors, like Dr. Luke Mayer and Steven Kryk, for encouraging his growth and for the practical insights that would benefit him in internships. The culmination of his studies was marked by involvement in **solar energy projects**, and even an innovative **solar cooking stone**, emphasizing his commitment to sustainable **engineering**.

In addition to his academic pursuits, Vaughn balanced life on the court by getting involved with the university's **pickleball** team, where he achieved significant success, winning championships and exhibiting a blend of competitive spirit and camaraderie.

## Looking to the Future

As Vaughn prepares for a pivotal role at the **U.S. Department of Defense**, he reflects on the unique path that led him from the **cornfields** of Illinois to a **nuclear engineering** position at one of America's most historical naval sites. Through dedication, innovation, and a sprinkle of competitive spirit, he embodies how passion and perseverance can lead to remarkable futures.

Vaughn’s narrative serves as an inspiration not only to future engineers but to individuals navigating their unique pathways. Through his journey, he reminds us that every seemingly trivial experience—from **potato guns** to competitive **pickleball**—can indeed pave the way to extraordinary destinations. His journey solidifies the belief that creativity reigns, providing the bridges we need toward our aspirations.
