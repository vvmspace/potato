# Easy Potato Recipes for Two

Not feeding a whole commune? These recipes scale life down to two – company, not a crowd. No leftovers, no witnesses. Embrace the intimacy of cooking with just enough potatoes to satisfy, without the risk of an entire week’s worth of meals weighing down your fridge.

## Comfort with a Crunch

Take roasted potatoes as a classic touch–just the right amount to enjoy the crispy texture and earthy flavor without the dread of tomorrow's gig economy-sized portion. Toss *two medium potatoes* with olive oil, salt, and your choice of herbs, then roast until golden. 

## Creamy Mashed Perfection

When life gives you potatoes, speak their language with creamy mashed potatoes. Peel *two potatoes*, boil them until tender, and mash them with a splash of cream. Add a dollop of butter, and voilà, a side dish worthy of a memory.

## Spud-tacular Stir-Fry

For a quick and satisfying dinner, slice *one large potato* and throw it into your favorite stir-fry mix. Toss in some veggies and protein, and you'll have a meal that makes it feel like you actually cooked for a crowd, even if it’s just for two.

By the end of this culinary journey, you’ll find joy in the little moments, creating delightful dishes that remind you that quality often triumphs over quantity. Enjoy your time in the kitchen—where two is just the right number.
