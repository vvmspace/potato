# Wes Avila's Game-Changing Sweet Potato Taco Is Back In Flauta Form

Thirteen years after Wes Avila first turned the classic *taco de papa* on its head by using in-season, local sweet potatoes, he continues to evolve his iconic, accidentally vegetarian taco. Avila’s sweet potato taco has been copied by many in L.A. and beyond. It’s also one of the best-sellers at his taquería in Kyoto, PioPiko, proving that this taco is also effectively huge in Japan.

“**If you could copyright taco recipes like you can copyright lyrics or music, I’d be a rich man,**” Avila jokes inside the elegant dining room of his eight-month-old new restaurant. “But nah man, I get it. As a chef, inspiration comes from everywhere.”

Avila’s sweet potato taco now comes in a superlatively crunchy flauta filled with fluffy steamed Okinawan sweet potato and fried in rice bran oil. It has become a best-seller at [MXO by Wes Avila](https://www.instagram.com/mxobywesavila/), his Mexican steakhouse on La Cienega.

Closer to home, a variation of that taco sits comfortably on Andrew Ponce’s menu at Silver Lake's modern Mexican restaurant, [A Tí](https://lataco.com/a-ti-andrew-ponce-bestia).

“The first time I had a sweet potato taco from chef Wes, **it completely changed the way I looked at tacos**,” Ponce tells L.A. TACO.

Chef Wes Avila is not just changing the game; he’s redefining what a taco can be. Indulge in the *flautas de camote* and taste the evolution of flavor that’s captivating taco enthusiasts everywhere.
