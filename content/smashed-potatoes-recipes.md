# Smashed Potatoes Recipes: Culinary Chaos on a Plate

Angry? Take it out on your potatoes. **Smashed potatoes** are the ultimate culinary catharsis—crispy edges, soft centers, and everything good about destruction in culinary form. This isn’t just a recipe; it’s a way to channel your frustration into a delicious feast. Perfect for a side dish or a snack, smashed potatoes are versatile and oh-so-satisfying.

## The Art of Smashed Potatoes

To begin, gather your ingredients. You’ll need:

- **Small to Medium Potatoes**: Gold or red potatoes are ideal for their creamy texture.
- **Olive Oil**: For that golden brown finish.
- **Salt and Pepper**: Seasoning that makes everything better.
- **Optional Flavorings**: Think garlic, rosemary, or parmesan for a twist.

### How to Smash Potatoes

1. **Boil Your Potatoes**: Place your potatoes in a pot of salted water. Bring to a boil and cook until they're fork-tender, usually around 15-20 minutes.
2. **Drain and Dry**: Once cooked, drain the potatoes and let them sit for a few minutes to remove excess moisture. This step ensures they crisp up nicely.
3. **Smashing**: Using a potato masher or the bottom of a glass, gently press down on each potato until it’s smashed but not completely obliterated. You're aiming for a rustic look here.
4. **Drizzle with Olive Oil**: Place smashed potatoes on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Season generously with salt and pepper.
5. **Bake**: Pop them in a preheated oven at 450°F (230°C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and crispy.

### Flavor Variants

Let’s not pretend these can’t be enhanced. The beauty of smashed potatoes lies in their adaptability. Here are some ways to add flair:

- **Garlic Herb Smashed Potatoes**: Mix minced garlic with olive oil before drizzling, and add fresh herbs before baking.
- **Cheesy Smashed Potatoes**: Sprinkle shredded cheese on top during the last few minutes of baking for a melty, gooey finish.
- **Spicy Smashed Potatoes**: Add chili flakes or a drizzle of spicy oil for those who like a kick.

### The Perfect Serving and Storage

Serve smashed potatoes hot, garnished with fresh herbs or a dollop of sour cream. They make a delightful complement to meats, fish, or even as a standalone dish. 

Got leftovers? Store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven to retain that delicious crunch.

### In Conclusion: Why You Need Smashed Potatoes in Your Life

Smashed potatoes are not just a side dish; they're an experience. The contrast of soft and crispy textures creates a symphony of satisfaction. Whether you’re dealing with anger or simply wanting to indulge, making smashed potatoes can turn your mood around. So go ahead, embrace the chaos, and let the smashed potatoes do the talking.
