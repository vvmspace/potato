# Meet the woman running in the SLC marathon dressed as a potato

SALT LAKE CITY — After a nationwide search, the second ever “**Speedy Spud**” will race in the **Salt Lake City Marathon** dressed in a *potato costume*. **Ainsley Chapman**, an athlete and full-time engineer, was recently chosen to represent potato farmers across the U.S.

“*Potatoes are an American classic*. I have been eating them for as long as I have been living,” Chapman told ABC4.com. She emphasizes their nutrient-dense benefits linked to running, making it a priority to fuel her body with this humble vegetable.

_Ainsley Chapman is being sponsored for her half marathon by Potatoes USA on behalf of potato farmers nationwide._

The initiative began in 2024, aiming to promote potato farming across the country. **Potatoes USA**, a potato marketing and research organization, started collaborating with athletes to highlight the virtues of the beloved vegetable.

When not working full-time or studying for her master’s degree, Chapman is training for the upcoming half marathon and preparing nutritious meals fueled by her love for potatoes. “It’s been fun to tell my friends about Speedy Spud and incorporate more potatoes into their routines,” she shared.
