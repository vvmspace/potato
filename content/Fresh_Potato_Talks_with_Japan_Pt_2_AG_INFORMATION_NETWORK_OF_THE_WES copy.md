# Fresh Potato Talks with Japan Pt 2

Talk about spud diplomacy and get ready for a mash-up of agricultural insights. This report shines a light on the ongoing discussions about **fresh potato** trade with Japan. Given the historical context and current market dynamics, this isn’t just a casual sit-down; it’s about forging valuable connections.

## Insights into the Trade Relationship

Under the surface of these talks lies potential for better trade agreements. Kam Quarles, CEO at the National Potato Council, emphasizes that having U.S. fresh potato access in Japan is a top agricultural priority. After all, who doesn’t want their potatoes enjoyed globally? 

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Quarles points out, “It’s a bit early to make assumptions.” The groundwork is being laid, and with patience, we might soon be seeing fresh potatoes making their way into Japanese kitchens. 

Quarles touches on the broader implications too. With countries linked to the former Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (yes, the one that slipped through our fingers) looking to restore previous tariffs, the future could usher in an easy access wave for potato products, especially those frozen delights everyone adores.

Understanding the intricacies of tariffs and trade barriers is crucial. The U.S. potato industry’s dependence on exports makes the stakes high. Keep an eye on this developing narrative—it's not just about potatoes; it's about international cooperation over culinary delights.

The tantalizing prospect of a fresh potato collaboration with Japan wraps this conversation with hope. A step into the uncharted territory of trading crops could mean transforming how we savor our beloved tubers. Who knows? The next savory dish you enjoy might just have traveled from the fields of the U.S. to a plate in Japan.
