# VEGAS MYTHS RE-BUSTED: Crooks Robbed a Potato Chip Truck Thinking it Had Casino Chips

In a bizarre twist of fate, dim-witted bandits once attempted to rob a *Vegas Chips* truck, convinced it was laden with valuable casino chips. These criminals, armed with knives, commandeered the truck from its driver, Rodney Dwayne Bont, forcing him to drive to a remote area. Once there, the thieves eagerly demanded he open the back doors, expecting to uncover a treasure trove of gambling riches.

## The Unexpected Reveal of Potato Chips

Upon opening the truck, instead of *casino chips*, they were met with cardboard boxes filled with the potato variety of Vegas chips. Their disappointment quickly morphed into fury, resulting in them assaulting Bont and robbing him of the $680 he had on him. It’s a crime that momentarily captured national headlines, largely due to its absurdity.

But as the story unfolded, the truth was even stranger than fiction. Just a week after the heist, police uncovered that Bont had orchestrated the robbery himself to settle his mounting gambling debts. With a history of theft-related felonies, he ultimately faced legal repercussions for his misguided scheme but received a reduced sentence due to counseling efforts for his gambling addiction.

## A Myth for the Ages

Interestingly, the originally sensational narrative had a greater following than the reality, demonstrating how myths can oftentimes outshine the facts. The *Vegas Chips* company even leveraged the incident for a commercial campaign, echoing the sentiment, “You gotta hold ’em, not hold ’em up.” This only added layers to the urban legend of the robbery.

As we explore the *Vegas myths*, it's inherent that not all truths lead to glorious tales, and sometimes, reality is just as bizarre—if not more so—than fiction.

Embrace the unpredictable nature of tales that weave through the threads of gambling culture and Las Vegas history, where the line between truth and myth often blurs.
