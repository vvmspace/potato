# Potentially Good News for Potato Growers

The potato industry is buzzing with excitement as discussions unfold regarding potential **better access** for U.S. potatoes in Japan. This development comes as the Trump administration initiates talks aimed at removing both **tariff** and **non-tariff trade barriers** that have long hindered U.S. agricultural exports.

## Bright Prospects for Exports

According to the National Potato Council CEO Kam Quarles, the efforts to secure fresh potato access to Japan have been ongoing. He affirms, “Since it became obvious that there was going to be a negotiation, specifically with Japan, we have been pushing the administration.” Success in these negotiations could yield an estimated **$150 million annually** in new agricultural exports.

However, the road ahead is not without obstacles. Years of negotiations have yielded little progress, and Quarles highlights that Japan has historically preferred to “continue to negotiate on this thing until the end of time.” Yet, the prospect of overcoming such protectionism remains.

## The Bigger Picture

The discussions are also interconnected with a broader agreement involving countries formerly part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, including **Vietnam**, **Thailand**, **Taiwan**, and the **Philippines**. These nations are looking to restore previous tariff benefits that would facilitate easier access for **potato products**, especially frozen ones.

### Conclusion

With a significant portion of the U.S. potato industry reliant on exports, the potential lifting of trade barriers represents a beacon of hope. Optimism is cautiously high, and as the situation unfolds, it may pave the way for a brighter future for American potato growers.
