Welcome to the world of indulgent potato snacks! The aloo corn cutlet is a crisp, delightful treat cherished by potato enthusiasts. Sink your teeth into this easy recipe that combines the creaminess of mashed potatoes with crunchy corn for an unforgettable snack experience.

## Ingredients for Aloo Corn Cutlet

- 2 cups parboiled corn kernels  
- 4 boiled **potatoes**, mashed  
- 1 tbsp chilli flakes  
- 2 green chillies, finely chopped  
- ½ inch ginger, finely chopped  
- ½ tsp pepper powder  
- 1 tsp each: chilli powder & chaat masala  
- ½ cup coriander leaves, finely chopped  
- 1 cup breadcrumbs  
- 1 tbsp rice flour  
- 2 tsp salt, or to taste  
- Oil for frying  

## Preparation Steps

### Step 1  

Take the parboiled corn kernels and reserve 1 tablespoon. Grind the remaining kernels until you get a coarse mixture.

### Step 2  

In a large bowl, mix the ground corn with the whole kernels you set aside earlier. Add all the other listed ingredients and mash everything until combined well.

### Step 4  

While frying, flip the cutlets so both sides cook evenly and turn crispy and golden brown. Pair the aloo corn cutlets with chutney, ketchup, or your favorite dips.
