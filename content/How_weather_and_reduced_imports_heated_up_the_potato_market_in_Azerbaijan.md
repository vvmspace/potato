# High Potato Prices Persist in Azerbaijan Due to Poor Harvests

In Azerbaijan, the potato market is heating up, with prices reaching record highs this April. Amid the backdrop of a new harvest season, customers are facing a hefty price tag for this staple vegetable.  

## The Current Potato Pricing Situation

In retail markets across the country, a kilogram of potatoes is selling between AZN 1.7 to AZN 3 (roughly USD 1 to USD 1.76), marking a steep increase—almost double—compared to the same time last year. Early varieties are even higher, with costs ranging from AZN 3 to AZN 4 (around USD 1.76 to USD 2.35) per kilogram.

## Why Are Potato Prices So High?

The chairman of the Center for Liberal Economists, Akif Nasirli, attributes this spike to poor yields from last season, exacerbated by unstable weather conditions. He stated:

> "As a result, less produce was harvested. And now the market mainly offers potatoes from last year's harvest, which is why its price remains high."

Delays in early potato supplies, mainly due to heavy rainfall, along with a significant reduction in imports, have also contributed to this scarcity in the market. Nasirli explains:

> "The reduction in imports combined with delays in early potato supplies led to a market shortage, which caused the price increase."

However, there is a silver lining on the horizon. A surge in the supply of local early potatoes is anticipated within the coming week, which should ease the current price crunch.

Despite the current challenges, the potato market in Azerbaijan shines a light on the resilience of local agriculture, promising relief soon for avid potato lovers.
