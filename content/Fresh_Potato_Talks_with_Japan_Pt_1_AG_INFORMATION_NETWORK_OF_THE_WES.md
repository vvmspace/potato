# Fresh Potato Talks with Japan Pt 1

From the Ag Information Network, I’m Bob Larson. **Potentially good** news for potato growers as word gets out that the Trump administration has begun talks with Japan to eliminate tariff and non-tariff trade barriers.

## The Importance of Trade Access

National Potato Council CEO, Kam Quarles, says they’ve been pushing for this access for years. If granted, it could mean **about $150 million a year in new U.S. ag exports**.

> “Clearly, I think the Japanese would prefer to continue to negotiate on this until the end of time,” Quarles remarks, highlighting the enduring nature of these discussions.

**Stay tuned** for further updates on this essential matter for fresh U.S. potato exports to Japan.
