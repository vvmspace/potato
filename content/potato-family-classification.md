# Potato: Family & Classification

Your high school biology teacher’s nightmare, simplified: where the potato lives on the plant family tree (spoiler: nightshade family). This tuberous delight falls under the *Solanaceae* family, known for housing other incredibly diverse and striking plants, both edible and poisonous.

## Delving into Potato Taxonomy

The scientific name of the potato is *Solanum tuberosum*. Let’s peel back the layers of its classification, shall we? 

Potatoes belong to the order "Solanales" and the class "Eudicots". Understanding these classifications not only helps you appreciate the potato you love but also highlights the relationships it shares with other plants in its family. 

### Related Plants to Potato

Since potatoes are part of the nightshade family, you might recognize relatives like tomatoes, eggplants, and bell peppers. However, tread carefully; while many relatives are delicious, some are toxic—think of *Solanum nigrum*, or black nightshade. 

In summary, knowing the potato's classification can enhance your culinary adventures and help you avoid potential pitfalls. So the next time you dig into a creamy potato dish, remember its fascinating roots in the plant kingdom—because knowledge can elevate your dining experience, or maybe just save your pet from a nasty mistake.
