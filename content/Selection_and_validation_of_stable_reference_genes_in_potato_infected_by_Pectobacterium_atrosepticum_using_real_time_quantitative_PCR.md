# Selection and Validation of Stable Reference Genes in Potato Infected by Pectobacterium atrosepticum Using Real-time Quantitative PCR

This study delves into the vital role of stable **reference genes** in the study of **potato** response to **Pectobacterium atrosepticum** infection. It identifies and validates the effectiveness of specific genes for accurate normalization in **real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)** analysis, which is crucial for measuring gene expression levels in biological research.

## Understanding the Importance of Reference Genes in Potato Research

In the context of molecular plant pathology, the expression stability of candidate reference genes is paramount, especially in assessing the resistance mechanisms in potato varieties infected by **Pectobacterium atrosepticum**. The findings reveal that **EF1Î±** exhibits superior stability compared to other candidates, making it a reliable choice for further investigations into the gene expression profile under pathogen stress. This research serves as a cornerstone for subsequent evaluations aimed at enhancing disease resistance in potato crops.

As we conclude, the exploration of reference genes not only enhances our understanding of the complex interaction between potato plants and bacterial pathogens but also opens pathways for future genetic improvements in crop resilience.
