# Where to Find Lemonade Potato Chips in Indiana

This limited-edition potato chip flavor is way too interesting not to try.

Like millions, I am a major fan of **potato chips**. It's truly a comfort food and the perfect late-night snack. We all have our go-to brands and flavors. For me, it's Lay's Salt and Vinegar. I could eat a whole bag in one sitting. However, when it comes to chips, I'll pretty much eat any kind. Especially the unique flavors that brands release from time to time. That being said, over the past couple of years, there have been some new flavors that have come out that were a tad odd. When it comes to strange and unique **potato chip** flavors that have come out, I think they all pale in comparison to the newest flavor.
