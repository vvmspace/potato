# Baked Potatoes Recipes

Nothing says "do less" quite like a baked potato. Still, there’s technique. This is everything you need for jacket potatoes that don’t judge—but could.

## Techniques for Perfect Baked Potatoes

To bake potatoes like a pro, start by **choosing the right kind of potatoes**. Russet potatoes are ideal for their starchy texture. Ensure they are clean and dry before you begin. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C), which creates that much-needed crispy skin.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Prep Your Potatoes**: Prick each potato several times with a fork. This allows steam to escape during baking, preventing them from bursting.
   
2. **Seasoning**: Rub them with olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt. This not only adds flavor but also enhances the skin’s crispiness.

3. **Baking Time**: Place the potatoes directly on the oven rack. Bake for about 45-60 minutes, depending on size. They’re done when a fork easily slides into the center.

4. **Finishing Touches**: Once baked, let them sit for a few minutes before slicing open. Add butter, sour cream, chives, or your topping of choice.

## Variations on the Classic

Feeling adventurous? Try adding different toppings or stuffing your baked potatoes with ingredients like cheese, broccoli, or chili. The variations are endless and are sure to elevate your potatoes from simple to spectacular.

## Conclusion

Baked potatoes are the ultimate comfort food—easy to make, versatile, and always satisfying. Not only that, they can serve as a blank canvas for your culinary creativity. So embrace the simplicity of baked potatoes, and enjoy the deliciousness of this classic dish. Whether as a side or the star of your meal, baked potatoes are always a win.
