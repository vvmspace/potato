# Cathy Whims Shares Her Cookbook 'The Italian Summer Kitchen' + Her Potato Gnocchi Recipe

Cathy Whims, a celebrated Portland chef and 6-time James Beard award nominee, hopes her new cookbook, "The Italian Summer Kitchen: Timeless Recipes for La Dolce Vita," will inspire us to slow down, cook a little, and enjoy the **flavors** of the **season**. 

## Magical Potato Gnocchi

You’ve probably cooked shelf-stable **gnocchi** from the supermarket—chewy, firm dumplings that sink to the bottom of your stomach like lead balloons. If that’s your preference, this is not the recipe for you. The best **gnocchi** should be pillowy and light, magically straddling the line between firm and falling apart, a technique perfected by the late, great Marcella Hazan. 

To make these truly divine dumplings, start with **1 1/2 pounds** of Yellow Finn or Yukon Gold potatoes, cover them with water in a large pot, bring to a boil, and simmer until tender—about 20 minutes. Drain and peel while hot, then press through a potato ricer or mash thoroughly. 

### Gnocchi Know-How

- **Perfect potatoes:** Choose medium-starch potatoes for a rich potato flavor without excess water.
- **Add flour with caution:** Aim for a dough that is smooth but not sticky, adjusting flour as necessary based on feel.
- **Skip the egg:** For light and fluffy texture, leave it out.
- **Best made fresh:** Cook **gnocchi** shortly after shaping for the best texture. 

Gnocchi can be tossed in multiple sauces for a dinner party, offering a vibrant culinary homage to the Italian flag! This recipe isn't just a dish; it's a vibrant, fulfilling experience—one sure to linger in your memory long after the plate is cleared.
