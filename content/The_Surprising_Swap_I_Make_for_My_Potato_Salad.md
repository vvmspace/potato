# The Surprising Swap I Make for My Potato Salad

When it comes to classic **potato salad**, most people stick to the tried and true ingredients: boiled potatoes, mayo, mustard, and a sprinkle of herbs. But what if I told you that the secret to taking your **potato salad** from mundane to memorable lies in a surprising swap? It’s time to shake things up!

## The Unexpected Ingredient

Imagine replacing **traditional mayonnaise** with something that not only enhances the flavor but also adds a delightful creaminess. Enter **Greek yogurt**. This ingredient not only lightens the dish but packs in some extra protein and tang, making your **potato salad** a bit healthier without sacrificing a bit of indulgence.

### Why Make the Switch?

- **Flavor Enhancement**: Greek yogurt adds a richer taste profile, cutting through the richness of the **potatoes** while offering a subtle zing.
- **Healthier Option**: Lower in calories and fat compared to mayonnaise, Greek yogurt invites you to indulge guilt-free.
- **Creamy Texture**: It gives that lusciousness we crave in a good **potato salad**, but with an added nutritional boost.

### Bringing It All Together

Start by boiling your **potatoes** until they’re tender and let them cool slightly. In a bowl, mix **Greek yogurt** with a dash of Dijon mustard, a splash of apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper. Combine this creamy mixture with your cooled **potatoes**, chopped celery, and green onions. With each bite, you'll experience a vibrant flavor that’s far from the ordinary, and it might just become your new go-to recipe.

In the end, this simple swap transforms a classic dish into something extraordinary. So the next time you're tasked with bringing a **potato salad** to a gathering, surprise everyone with this delightful twist that they didn’t know they were missing. 

Enjoy the unexpected delight—because who doesn't love a little transformation in the kitchen?
