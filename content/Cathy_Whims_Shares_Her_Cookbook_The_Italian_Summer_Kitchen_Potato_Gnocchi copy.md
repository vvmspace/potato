# Cathy Whims Shares Her Cookbook 'The Italian Summer Kitchen' + Her Potato Gnocchi Recipe

Cathy Whims, a celebrated Portland chef and six-time James Beard award nominee, encourages us to **slow down, cook**, and savor the flavors of the seasons in her new cookbook, *The Italian Summer Kitchen: Timeless Recipes for La Dolce Vita*. Here, she shares her insights on making perfect **potato gnocchi**.

## Creating Ethereal Potato Gnocchi

You may have cooked shelf-stable gnocchi that can sink like lead in your stomach. This **gnocchi recipe** aims to provide the kind of pillowy, light texture that brings joy in every bite, a lesson learned from the late Marcella Hazan. 

**Ingredients:**
- 1 1/2 pounds Yellow Finn or Yukon Gold **potatoes** (not newly dug)
- 3/4 to 1 1/4 cups (90 to 150 g) all-purpose flour
- Flaky sea salt
- Sauce (Marcella Hazanâ€™s Tomato-Butter Sauce or Basil Pesto)
- 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano for garnish

**Cooking Instructions:**
1. Boil the **potatoes** until tender. 
2. Press through a potato ricer or mash well, then incorporate flour gradually.
3. Knead until the dough is soft yet not sticky.
4. Roll into logs, cut pieces, and shape using a fork for grooves.
5. Boil in batches and serve with your preferred sauce along with grated cheese.

This recipe emphasizes using the right **potato** and mastering the technique, proving that good **potato gnocchi** is all about the details.
