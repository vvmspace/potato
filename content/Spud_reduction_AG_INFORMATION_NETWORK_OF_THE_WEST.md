# Spud Reduction: A Turning Point for American Potatoes

In a startling shift for the agricultural landscape, **Idaho potato acres** are set to decrease by **15,000 acres** this year compared to 2024. This equates to a **5 percent drop** from **315,000 acres** in 2024 to **300,000 acres** in 2025.

## Analyzing the Potato Industry

The **total U.S. potato acreage** is also forecast to fall by **4 percent**, dropping from **930,000 acres** in 2024 to **891,000 acres** in 2025. These projections, outlined in the **April 10 edition** of the *North American Potato Market News*, reveal broader implications for the industry.

Projections indicate that **Idaho**, along with **Washington**, **Oregon**, and **Maine**, will experience the largest acreage reductions. All three major frozen potato processors have instituted significant contract cuts for the upcoming crop year, ranging from **5-15 percent**, pushing some growers completely out of contracts. As stated in the report, “raw-product supplies are plentiful,” leading to surplus spuds finding new use in feedlots.

## The Future of Potatoes

Despite the challenging landscape, optimism remains. If average yields are achieved, American farmers are predicted to produce about **410 million hundredweight** of potatoes in 2025, potentially exceeding production levels from 2022. It's worth noting that **Idaho farmers** typically account for about a third of the nation’s potato supply.

While the reduction in contract acres poses challenges, it also suggests a possible increase in **open-market potatoes** this year. Farmers may take risks by planting more uncontracted potatoes, hoping to meet processor demand later in the season.

Despite the unwavering hardships, **Potatoes USA** emphasizes the resilience of the industry. "Consumers love our product," declares **Kim Breshears**, Chief Marketing Officer, reminding us that *potatoes remain America’s favorite vegetable*.

As we navigate this pivotal phase in potato farming, there's hope that farmers will adapt and continue to cultivate the beloved spud, ensuring its place at the American table for years to come.
